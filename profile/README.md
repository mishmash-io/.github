# mishmash io

`mishmash io` is a distributed, schema-less database that speeds up complex algorithms such as ML and AI. [Find out more on our website.](https://mishmash.io)

Here you can find code that we have released publicly:
- `mishmash io` db client libraries for [supported programming languages](https://mishmash.io/docs/languages)
- `mishmash io` db connectors for popular messaging systems and other [integrations.](https://mishmash.io/integrations)
- Other open source [software that we develop](https://mishmash.io/open_source) which is not directly related to our database.

**Note:** Open-sourcing our code is an ongoing effort! Follow us here for updates or on other [social media channels.](https://mishmash.io/about)
